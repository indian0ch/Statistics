# Statistics
## Sampling Method
This folder contains the implementation of various sampling methods used in the field of mathematical statistics. The following steps were performed:

### Ranking the sample:
The sample data points were ranked in ascending order.

### Grouping the variants into intervals:
The ranked data points were grouped into separate intervals, thereby performing data grouping. The grouped ranked data was then transformed into a tabular format.

### Graphical characteristics of the interval distribution:
The interval variation table was used to generate graphical representations, including the polygon, histogram, and cumulative distribution function (CDF).

### Calculation of descriptive statistics:

- Mean of the interval variation;
- Median and mode of the distribution;
- Variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the distribution;
- Skewness and kurtosis of the distribution;

The implemented sampling methods and statistical analyses provide insights into the characteristics and properties of the data. These steps are crucial for understanding the underlying distribution and drawing meaningful conclusions in the field of mathematical statistics.
